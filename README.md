# Space-X-Project

The project task is to predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Data science methodologies have been applied to analyse launch data and optimise prediction of launches. SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
<br/>
First we get the data from API or using web scraping and convert it to <bold>DataFrame</bold>
<br/>
Then we clean the data an handle missing values 
</br>
Finally we use foure machine learning methods to estimate the best model.

<h3>1. Logistic Regression :</h3>Logistic regression is a binary classification model that uses a logistic function to map input variables to a probability of belonging to a particular class. It is widely used in machine learning applications where the goal is to predict a binary outcome.
<br/>
<h3>2. KNN :</h3>The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric classification method that assigns a test data point to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. It is a simple yet effective machine learning model used for both classification and regression problems.
<br/>
<h3>3. Decision Tree :</h3>A decision tree is a hierarchical model that uses a tree-like structure to recursively partition the input data into smaller subsets, with each internal node representing a test on a feature, and each leaf node representing a class label. It is a popular machine learning model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and is known for its interpretability and ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
<br/>
<h3>4. SVM :</h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification model that finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes, using a kernel function to map input data into higher-dimensional space. It is widely used in various machine learning applications due to its ability to handle complex datasets and high accuracy in both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
