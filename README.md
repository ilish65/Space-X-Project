# Space-X-Project

The project task is to predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. Data science methodologies have been applied to analyse launch data and optimise prediction of launches. SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

we use foure machine learning methods to estimate the best model.

1. <h2> Logistic Regression :</h2>Logistic regression is a binary classification model that uses a logistic function to map input variables to a probability of belonging to a particular class. It is widely used in machine learning applications where the goal is to predict a binary outcome.
   <br/>
   2.<h2>KNN :</h2>The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric classification method that assigns a test data point to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. It is a simple yet effective machine learning model used for both classification and regression problems.
   <br/>
2. <h2>Decision Tree :</h2>A decision tree is a hierarchical model that uses a tree-like structure to recursively partition the input data into smaller subsets, with each internal node representing a test on a feature, and each leaf node representing a class label. It is a popular machine learning model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and is known for its interpretability and ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
   <br/>
   4.<h2>SVM :</h2>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification model that finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes, using a kernel function to map input data into higher-dimensional space. It is widely used in various machine learning applications due to its ability to handle complex datasets and high accuracy in both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
